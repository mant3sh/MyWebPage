        As a passionate traveler, one of my favorite things to do is to explore
        the food and culture of different places. I love trying new dishes and
        learning about the history and traditions behind them. Food is such an
        integral part of any culture, and I believe that by trying local dishes,
        you can truly understand and appreciate a place and its people.

      <br />
      <p className="text-left dark:text-white">
        But it's not just about the food itself. I also love learning about the
        history and traditions behind the dishes I try.These little bits of
        history add so much depth and flavor to the food I try, and they make
        the experience so much more meaningful.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="text-left dark:text-white">
        Overall, I believe that food is an essential part of any travel
        experience. It allows you to truly understand and appreciate the culture
        of a place, and it can be a delicious and exciting adventure in itself.
        I can't wait to continue exploring the world and trying all the amazing
        dishes it has to offer.

        Started Playing Cricket when i was kid ever since actively pursued
        playing cricket,made great friends because of it and always had fun
        playing along side so many amazing people Cricket is my passion, and I
        absolutely love watching the game. There's something about the
        combination of skill, strategy, and athleticism that makes it so
        captivating to watch. Whether it's a tense Test match or a high-scoring
        Twenty20 game, I always find myself on the edge of my seat when I'm
        watching cricket.

        Ever since my childhood I've been interested in tech, computers etc.
        Trying different OSs was my favorite weekend thing (and completing silly
        Pok√©mon emulator games on NDS, GBA). Was always tweaking my computers
        and phones with different mods. After studying PCM for some years,
        managed to gain admission and pursue undergratuate in Engineering. Got
        hooked to JavaScript when I started coding and was fascinated about the
        ecosystem. I was lucky enough to have people support me in all hobbies
        and activities that I pursued and had a really fulfilling life so far.
